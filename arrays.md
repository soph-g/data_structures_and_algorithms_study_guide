# Arrays

## Prerequisites

Having a basic understanding of [Big O Notation](./big_o_notation.md) will be helpful for understanding the time and space complexity of arrays and array operations.

Array is usually available as a [Built-in Type](./built_in_types.md).

## Introduction

An array is a list of objects, each object can be accessed using the index for that object.

Arrays are commonly seen in LeetCode style questions, because they are extremely versatile. Having a good understanding of how arrays work, their performance constraints, and how to interact with them, will prepare the path for you to learn:

- Stacks
- Binary Trees
- Graphs

It is important to note that you will very likely be used to working with *dynamic arrays* that automatically resize to accommodate new inputs, but it's useful to be aware of the fixed-length array.

## Study Areas

- [ ] Know how to create, view and manipulate arrays in your chosen language (push, pop, delete, lookup element at index i, retrieve length)
- [ ] Know the time and space complexity of these operations
- [ ] Understand the difference between fixed-length and dynamic arrays
- [ ] The String data type is very similar to an Array. Look up how many Array methods are also present on String in your chosen language
- [ ] Practice iterating over an array using a 'pointer' method. You might find yourself having to use multiple pointers to solve an array question.
- [ ] Practice building and iterating over a two-dimensional array - another common pattern you might see in interview questions.

### Going Further

- Could you implement a fixed-length array, with `push`, `pop` and `delete` methods, without using a built in Array?
- Could you implement a dynamic array with the same methods, and a `length` property that returns the count of all elements in the array?
- It might also be worth looking into [Tuples](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/python/tuple), to understand how these differ from Arrays

## Practice Questions

These LeetCode questions are all about traversing and manipulating Arrays. As mentioned above, you will see arrays being used in increasingly complex questions, so I've kept it beginner-level for now.

## Next Steps

[Hash Tables](./hash_tables.md) are another useful data structure that is often provided as a built-in type, and it's a good next step from here.
