# :construction: Data Structures & Algorithms Study Guide :construction:

_NOTE this repo is under construction. It's being updated weekly and I aim to complete v1 by Feb 2026_

## Introduction

As a web development bootcamp graduate, I became increasingly aware of a Computer Science-shaped gap in my knowledge as my career progressed.

In particular I wanted to study Data Structures and Algorithms, but I struggled to find the time. That is, until a recruiter from Facebook (now Meta) reached out and asked me if I would consider interviewing. At the time, we were in the middle of COVID-19 lockdowns, so I had more free time than usual, and Facebook were happy to wait for me to prepare for the telephone interview, so I took the plunge.

I used roughly the approach I will detail here as my study guide, and learnt enough of the basics to pass the Facebook telephone screen in 12 weeks.

## What is this guide?

I have not provided much (if any) actual information in this guide. I think there are many people producing high-quality content, and they do a much better job than I could!
Instead, this is intended as a guide to structure your learning, and answer questions like:

* Where do I start?
* How much detail should I go into?
* Which algorithms should I learn first?
* What LeetCode problems should I practice?
* How do I get the most out of my study time?

You can use it as a complete study guide, and by the end of it you should be ready to face a traditional DS&A interview as a mid-level engineer.

Throughout the guide I have tried to provide a series of questions to guide your research, and links to resources that I think are high-quality.

## How to use this guide

If you are completely new to Data Structures & Algorithms, then I suggest starting with Big-O Notation and working through the suggested order.

If you are familiar with some of the concepts covered, then simply pick the area that interests you the most. 

If there are some concepts that need to be understood before the study area you are working on, then this should be clear from the material. I would suggest following this advice to avoid confusion and speed up the learning process!

You can clone this repo, and use it to track your learning. There are checkboxes to tick and spaces to add your own notes for this purpose.

## Index

### Possible starting points
Any of these topics would make a good starting point, but I suggest tackling them in order:

1. [Big O Notation](./big_o_notation.md)
2. [Built-in Types](./built_in_types.md)
3. [Arrays](./data_structures/arrays.md)

### Data Structures

4. [Hash Tables](./data_structures/hash_tables.md)
5. [Linked Lists](./data_structures/linked_lists.md)
6. [Queues](./data_structures/queues.md)
7. [Stacks](./data_structures/stacks.md)
8. [Trees](./data_structures/trees.md)
9. [Binary Trees](./data_structures/binary_tree.md)
10. [Binary Search Tree](./data_structures/binary_search_tree.md)
11. [Heaps](./data_structures/heaps.md)
12. [Graphs](./data_structures/graphs.md)

### Algorithms

1. [Binary Search](./algorithms/binary_search.md)
2. [Tree Traversals](./algorithms/tree_traversals.md)
3. [Depth First Search](./algorithms/depth_first_search.md)
4. [Breadth First Search](./algorithms/breadth_first_search.md)

_*A note on sorting:* sorting vary rarely comes up in interview questions, so if you're got this far give yourself a pat on the back.
At this point, if you are preparing for an interview, then it's a good idea to keep practicing with lots of different question types. Refer back to the [guide to LeetCode](./guide_to_leetcode.md) for a refresher on how to get the most out of your practice._  

5. Bubble Sort _(coming soon)_
6. Merge Sort _(coming soon)_
7. Quick Sort _(coming soon)_
8. Topological Sort _(coming soon)_

## I've spotted an error

Please open a pull request to correct it! Small changes don't need explaining in detail, but larger changes should have a detailed PR.
