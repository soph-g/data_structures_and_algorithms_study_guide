# Big O Notation

## Prerequistes

An understanding of basic formula notation, and foundational maths.

## Introduction
Before jumping into Data Structures & Algorithms, I think it's useful to understand _why_ knowing about DS&A is useful for engineers.

When dealing with small volumes of data, how long our code takes to run, and how much memory our programs consume, don't seem to matter than much.
However, if you ever find yourself having to process large datasets then you are very likely to want to optimise your code so that it runs efficiently, and consumes as little memory as possible.

This is where DS&A can help - different data structures offer different performance benefits, and algorithms are optimal approaches to solving different types of problems.

And where does Big O Notation fit in? It's the language that helps us express the space and time complexity of code - how long the code will take to run, in relation to the input, and how much memory it requires.

Understanding the basics of Big O Notation will help you to:
- Communicate the time and space complexity of code you write
- Understand the time and space complexity of code you are reading
- Understand and express the performance benefits and trade-offs of different data structures and algorithms

## Study Areas

You should aim to have a good grasp on the following concepts:

- [ ] Constant Time 
- [ ] Linear Time 
- [ ] Quadratic Time 
- [ ] Log Time

This means knowing the notation formula, and being familiar with at least one code example with that runtime, and be able to identify this runtime in a code example.

## Practice Tips

- When you are writing code, spend a few minutes to estimate the time and space complexity and express it in Big O. Can it be improved?
- Be sure to understand how constants are handled in Big O.
- Pratice estimating the runtime of complex code, and reducing the function down to it's simplest expression. It's helpful to look for examples of this (Cracking the Coding Interview is a good source for this)
- When you learn a new data structure or algorithm, understanding the time and space complexity should be part of your learning.

## Resources

### Paid
- [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://amzn.to/49E0hTc) _(affiliate link)_ includes a detailed introduction to Big O, and lots of code examples to work through. I think this book is worth the investment!

### Free
- [FreeCodeCamp - Big O Notation](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/big-o-notation-simply-explained-with-illustrations-and-video-87d5a71c0174) A good place to start with understanding Big-O in general
- [Interview Cake - Big O Notation](https://www.interviewcake.com/article/python/big-o-notation-time-and-space-complexity?) Gives some nice examples of calculating Big-O
- [Interview Cake - Cheatsheet](https://www.interviewcake.com/big-o-cheat-sheet) Has the time & space costs of major data structures and algorithms
- [Big O Notation Basics](https://dev.to/heyjtk/big-o-notation-basics-made-dead-simple-1c9m) A really nice comprehensive overview, with examples.  
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Orders_of_common_functions) - Great for pushing a bit further, I've linked to the list of common functions.

## Going Further

You can attempt to understand more of the common functions in [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Orders_of_common_functions), I recommend:
- polynormal
- exponential
- factorial

And then any others you're interested in.
