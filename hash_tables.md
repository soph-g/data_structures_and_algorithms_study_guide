# Hash Tables

## Prerequisites

It's probably a good idea to have a good grasp of [Arrays](./arrays.md) so you can better understand the differences between these two structures.

## Introduction

A Hash Table is a collection of key/value pairs - but unlike in an Array, the key can be specified as well as the value.

Hash Tables can also be referred to as Hashmaps, Maps, Dictionaries.

Hash tables are great for organising data by specific keys, rather than just the index approach offered by Arrays. You will probably come across Hash Tables being used to represent graph data structures.

Hash Tables can often be used to provide some structure to unstructured data (e.g. in an array).

## Study Areas

- [ ] Know how to create, view and manipulate hash tables in your chosen language (set, get, delete).
- [ ] Know the time and space complexity of these operations
- [ ] A Set could be see as a Hash Table where the value is always set to `true`. Take some time to understand how to create and manipulate a Set in your chosen language.

## Practice Questions

- [ ] [Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer)
- [ ] [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate)
- [ ] [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum) A LeetCode classic, and a good example of a common way to use Hash Tables. Definitely review a solution for this question.
- [ ] [Intersection of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/)
- [ ] [Restore Finishing Order](https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-finishing-order)

I recommend checking at least one solution for every problem you attempt. Even if you have solved the problem, it's very likely that your solution could be optimised or you will find a neat trick in one of the popular solutions.

- [Interview Cake article on Hash Tables](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/python/hash-map) You will see me reference Interview Cake in almost every module. I think these articles are conscise and to the point.

## Next Steps

Arrays and Hash Tables are probably the more common data types that you will come across. You're ready to start looking at something you might not have worked with before, a Linked List _(content coming soon)_.
