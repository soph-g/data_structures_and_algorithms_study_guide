# Built-in Types

## Prerequisites

None

## Introduction

Before jumping into more complex data types, it's a good idea to make sure you understand the basics of the built-in types provided in your chosen language.

Strings, Numbers & Booleans are standard - some languages might have additional special types e.g. `undefined` in JavaScript, and `:symbol` in Ruby.

There are also usually built-in versions of more complex data structures, like arrays and hash tables. 

Built-in objects will have their own set of methods, that can be used to create and mutate objects of that type, and access the object properties e.g. `"this string".length` to get the length of a string in JS.

It is helpful to be familiar with the common built-in types and methods in your language, and how to use the language documentation.

## Study Areas

You should be confident using the following types in your language:

- [ ] Strings - create, update, delete, read properties
- [ ] Numbers - number types available, min & max values
- [ ] Booleans - comparion operators, boolean values of other types e.g. string, empty string
- [ ] Array - create, update, delete, read properties
- [ ] Hash Table (map, hashmap, dict) - create, update, delete, read properties

Going further:
- [ ] Understand how variables are managed in RAM.

## Practice Questions

These Leetcode questions don't require any special data structure knowledge, they are all about strings and numbers. They provide a good opportunity to practice using LeetCode, writing your answers and seeing whether they pass the tests.

### Easy
- [ ] [Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer)
- [ ] [Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)
- [ ] [Length of Last Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word)
- [ ] [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

I wrote a short guide to LeetCode, [here](guide_to_leetcode.md).

## Learning Tips

- Push yourself to check the docs whenever you are looking for a way to do something, and really understand the capabilities of different methods.

## Resources

Below are links to documentation for common programming languages:

- [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/index.html)
- [Python](https://docs.python.org/release/3.14.2/library/stdtypes.html)
- [Ruby](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/)
- [JavaScript (MDN Docs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects)
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.type-system.php)

I think [this article](https://www.interviewcake.com/article/python/data-structures-coding-interview#ram) about Random Access Memory (RAM) is great for understanding the basics of what is going on under the hood.

## Going Further
If you haven't already, take a look at [Big O Notation](./big_o_notation.md).

Or, you can look at data structures in more detail, starting with Arrays _(content coming soon)_.
