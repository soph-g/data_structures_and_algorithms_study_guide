# Trees

## Prerequisites

Binary Tree is a type of [Tree](./trees.md), but arguably it doesn't matter which of these topics you jump into first.

But, if you haven't already looked at Trees, then definitely make sure you are familiar with [Linked Lists](./linked_lists.md) before starting this topic.

## Introduction

As already mentioned, Binary Trees are a subset of [Trees](./trees.md) - they have a root node, that can have 0 to 2 child nodes.

Each child node can also have 0 to 2 child nodes. No node can have more than 2 child nodes. The child nodes are usually referred to as the **left** and **right** nodes.

As in other Tree types, each node can have a value.

This structure makes the size of the tree easier to estimate, and the tree more predictable to navigate.

## Study Areas

- [ ] Be able to describe what is meant by the `root` of the Binary Tree
- [ ] Be able to describe what is meant by the `left` and `right` nodes.
- [ ] Draw a diagram of a `perfect` binary tree
- [ ] Draw a diagram of a `full` binary tree
- [ ] Draw a diagram of a `complete` binary tree
- [ ] Draw a diagram of a `balanced` binary tree
- [ ] Given the number of nodes in a tree, be able to calculate it's minimum height.
- [ ] Given the height of the tree, be able to calculate the maximum number of nodes
- [ ] Be able to represent a binary tree in an Array
