# Binary Search Trees

## Prerequisites

You should be familiar with [Binary Trees](./binary_tree.md) and [Tree Traversal](../algorithms/tree_traversals.md) before looking at Binary Search Trees

## Introduction

A Binary Search Tree is a Binary Tree with some special properties. For every node:
* The values to the left of the node will be lower than the value of the current node.
* The values to the right of the node will be higher than the value of the current node. 

If the binary search tree is _balanced_ then a binary search tree can match a sorted array for lookup time complexity, but insertions and deletions are faster in the binary tree.

## Study Areas
- [ ] Draw a diagram of 10 distinct integers in a balanced binary search tree
- [ ] Draw the same integers in an unbalanced binary search tree
- [ ] Express time costs of the following actions in a balanced binary search tree: lookup, insert, delete.
- [ ] Express the time costs of the same functions in an unbalanced binary tree.
- [ ] What traversal order would return the values in a binary search tree in sorted order, from smallest to largest?
- [ ] Try to build your own implementation of a binary search tree.
